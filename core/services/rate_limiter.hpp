/**
 * @file rate_limiter.hpp
 * @brief Sliding-window TX rate limiter (Plan 1 step 2).
 *
 * Hard cap on Argos TX activity over a rolling time window — designed as a
 * battery defense applied uniformly to every TX (including the first ping of
 * a SURFACING_BURST cycle, per user decision in Plan 1). State persists in
 * .noinit RAM (CRC16-validated) so the budget survives a soft reset; a real
 * power cut clears the ring, which is acceptable: the next bounded burst
 * post-boot is already throttled by GNSS/surface latency.
 *
 * Wired into ArgosTxService at two sites:
 *  - `service_next_schedule_in_ms()`  — gate before scheduling
 *  - `react(KineisEventTxComplete)`   — record successful TX
 *
 * DTE params: `RATE_LIMIT_EN` (RLP01), `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_S` (RLP02),
 * `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_TX` (RLP03). Disabled by default.

	// including multi-day rolling windows with dense surfacing patterns.

	// since boot) and become meaningless once the RTC jumps to real epoch
	// seconds. Without this, the `ts > now → skip` defense filters them all
