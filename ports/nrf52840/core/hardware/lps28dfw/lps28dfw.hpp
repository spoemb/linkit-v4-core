/**
 * @file lps28dfw.hpp
 * @brief LPS28DFW absolute pressure sensor driver (I2C, ST Micro).
 *
 * The LPS28DFW is a high-precision barometric pressure sensor with two
 * full-scale ranges: 1260 hPa (surface, higher precision) and 4060 hPa
 * (underwater, wider range).  Uses one-shot mode with 32-sample averaging.
 *
 * Registers are volatile — re-applied from m_mode on every read() since
 * VSENSORS power may have been cycled between reads.
 *
 * Used on RSPB board as the default pressure sensor (preferred over MS58xx).
